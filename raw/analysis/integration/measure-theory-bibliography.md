Terrence Tao's blog has [an article on outer measures, pre-measures and product measures](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/245a-notes-6-outer-measures-pre-measures-and-product-measures/) in which he emphasizes Caratheodory extension and also another on [an alternate approach to the theorem](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/254a-notes-0a-an-alternate-approach-to-the-caratheodory-extension-theorem/).
