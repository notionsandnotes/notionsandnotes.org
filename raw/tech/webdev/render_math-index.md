When I [intially made this blog]({filename}pelicanblog.md), I used the [render_math](https://github.com/barrysteyn/pelican_plugin-render_math)
plugin to display math. It made use of [MathJaX](https://www.mathjax.org/) to display mathematics encoded in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

This had one small glitch however. The article summaries in `index.html` of the base directory, if they had math, failed to load correctly and 
display MathJaX.

That was how I made [my first post in Github](https://github.com/barrysteyn/pelican_plugin-render_math/issues/19). I had originally imagined
that I must have missed something trivial and it was a bold step for me. The author, [Barry Steyn](https://github.com/barrysteyn), responded
promptly and offered a solution, which he also said was not completely trivial like I feared before daring to submit an issue. Moral: 
[Don't be so shy!!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder)

He kept to his word and today [updated the plugin](https://github.com/barrysteyn/pelican_plugin-render_math) which I have just cloned
and verified to be working.

Thanks a lot, man!! This addition beautifies this site a lot, considering the future plans to upload many more Math articles.
