### Introduction
-----------------------------

Caratheodory extension gives a `complete measure`, i.e., one in which all subsets of a set of measure
$0$ are measurable. Note that the $\sigma$-algebra obtained via the theorem is not is not the maximal class of subsets to which 
the measure can be extended.[^1]

[^1]: It can be shown for example that a measure on $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ that is properly contained
in the power set of $X$ can always be extended to a bigger $\sigma$-algebra. For a proof, see V. I. Bogachev,
Measure Theory.

Consider instead of a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ just an an algebra $\cal A$ of sets. If there is a set function $\ell$ 
on it  satisfying all the conditions of a measure whenever it makes sense(esp. countable additivity), it is called a
**measure on the algebra** $\cal A$.

We would like to extend the measure $\ell$ to the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\cal A$. provided the measure on $\cal A$ is $\sigma$-finite in the above sense. This is the process of Caratheodory 
extension, described below.
