<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
There was a presentation in the 1987-1988 Séminaire Bourbaki, titled *Nouvelles approches du «théorème» de Fermat*,
for which, [according to Loïc Merel](http://www.msri.org/workshops/447/schedules/3407) who was in the audience, 
the author was said to have presented the material with diabolical precision.

This was years before Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor's announced solution of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT). 

This talk/paper presented many attempted and possible approaches to solving FLT with the background of number theory,
algebraic geometry and diophantine approximation. It was/is a well-cited paper in the subject area.

We do a loose transcription of this document in English and provide some updated comments.

##New Approaches to Fermat's "Theorem"

**by Joseph Oesterlé**

Fermat's son published the *Works of Diophantus" in around 1670, five years after the death of his father. 

>**Observatio Domini Petri de Fermat**

>Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadrato-quadratum in duos quadrato-quadratos, 
>et generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos eiusdem 
>nominis fas est dividere cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. 
>Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.

A crude translation may be the following: 

> A cube into two cubes, or a square's square into two square's squares, and in general, 
no powers anymore beyond the square till infinity may be split into two of the same : 
a wonderful demonstration of which, indeed, exists. There is no space in the margin for this.

Fermat affirms that for $n \geq 3$ the equation

$$\begin{equation}x^n + y^n = z^n\end{equation}$$

has no integer solutions (with $xyz \neq 0).
