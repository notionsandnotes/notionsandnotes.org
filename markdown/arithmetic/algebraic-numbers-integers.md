<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
An algebraic number $\alpha$ satisfies a polynomial of the form $a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^n$ where $a_i \in \mathbb Q$ or by clearing denominators, $a_i \in \mathbb Z$. We may consider $\alpha \in \mathbb C$ or $\alpha \in \bar{\mathbb Q}$, the algebraic closure, per convenience. Attention of algebraic number theory is on the field generated by such an algebraic number than individual algebraic numbers. 

Let $K$ be an algebraic number field over $\mathbb Q$, i. e., a finite extension of $\mathbb Q$. This is always generated by a single element $\alpha \in K$ according to the primitive element theorem.

Then the set $\mathfrak{O}_K$ of algebraic integers in $K$, i. e., all elements in $K$ that satisfy a polynomial equation $a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^n$ where $a_0, a_1, \ldots \in \mathbb Z$, forms an integral domain whose field of quotients is $K$. The arithmetic (more precisely, multiplicative behavior) of ideals of this ring is similar to that of rational integers $\mathbb Z$ and satisfy a theorem of unique factorization into product of primes.

This article will develop the notions along the way and prove the above fact.
