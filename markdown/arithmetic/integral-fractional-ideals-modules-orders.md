<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
Let $K$ be an algebraic number field over $\mathbb Q$, i. e., a finite extension of $\mathbb Q$. Then the set $\mathfrak{O}_K$ of algebraic integers in $K$, i. e., all elements in $K$ that satisfy a polynomial equation $a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^n$ where $a_0, a_1, \ldots \in \mathbb Z$, forms an integral domain whose field of quotients is $K$. The arithmetic (more precisely, multiplicative behavior) of ideals of this ring
is similar to that of rational integers $\mathbb Z$ and satisfy a theorem of unique factorization into product of primes.

This article develops the notions along the way and state and prove this theorem.
