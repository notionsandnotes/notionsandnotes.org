Democracy is said to be the best, the most ideal, system; the one said to be `government of the people, by the people, for the people` by [Abraham Lincoln](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm).

Democracy worldwide is an imprint of the original from England, with some variations, most notable of which is the United States, which won “independence” from Britain through a war with the colonial master, and follows a system of directly elected presidents, governors, sherriffs, (some) judges etc., which may also may have some influences of the Roman republic, of the office of the consul, of the Senate, etc.. But otherwise, in most countries under the influence of the Anglosphere, including most former colonies of British empire and current members of its commonwealth, the structure of the state is influenced by the British model and therefore it may be of merit to study it.

Individual lawyers such as [Seth Abramson](http://bostonreview.net/us/seth-abramson-criminal-justice), retired judges like [J. F.](http://www.gvnews.com/news/review-the-fraternity-lawyers-and-judges-in-collusion/article_255cb34f-9d8a-537d-8149-d6fec5155bac.html) [Molloy](http://www.tulanelink.com/tulanelink/johnmolloy_box.htm), [B. S. Katz](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/burton-s-katz/justice-overruled/)  legal novel writers like Charles Dickens (Cf, [Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce), [Bleak House](http://charlesdickenspage.com/bleakhouse.html)[^DickensBleakHouse]), John Grisham[^GrishamRacketeer] Scott Turow[^TurowPresumed] and D. W. Buffa[^BuffaJudgement].

### British society
------------

To understand British society, one must understand the class system, where elites are educated at schools like Eton:

[![English Class System]({filename}/images/english-class-system-1.jpg)](https://twitter.com/historyinmoment/status/723037436205473792)

To contrast it properly, an image of how poor people lived will be apposite (click for more):

How did the upper class think of their social inferiors? 

Attitude of the English upper classes towards the working class is evident in the Malthusian theories: `That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence, That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and, That the superior power of population is repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice.`

Furthermore:

`It is an evident truth that, whatever may be the rate of increase in the means of subsistence, the increase of population must be limited by it, at least after the food has once been divided into the smallest shares that will support life. All the children born, beyond what would be required to keep up the population to this level, must necessarily perish, unless room be made for them by the deaths of grown persons. It has appeared indeed clearly in the course of this work, that in all old states the marriages and births depend principally upon the deaths, and that there is no encouragement to early unions so powerful as a great mortality. To act consistently therefore, we should facilitate, instead of foolishly and vainly endeavouring to impede, the operations of nature in producing this mortality; and if we dread the too frequent visitation of the horrid form of famine, we should sedulously encourage the other forms of destruction, which we compel nature to use. Instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we should encourage contrary habits. In our towns we should make the streets narrower, crowd more people into the houses, and court the return of the plague. In the country, we should build our villages near stagnant pools, and particularly encourage settlements in all marshy and unwholesome situations. But above all, we should reprobate specific remedies for ravaging diseases; and those benevolent, but much mistaken men, who have thought they were doing a service to mankind by projecting schemes for the total extirpation of particular disorders. If by these and similar means the annual mortality were increased from 1 in 36 or 40, to 1 in 18 or 20, we might probably every one of us marry at the age of puberty, and yet few be absolutely starved.`

We find Lord Bertrand Russell calmly discussing the problem of overpopulation:

`At present the population of the world is increasing at about 58,000 per diem. War, so far, has had no very great effect on this increase, which continued throughout each of the world wars. Until the last quarter of the nineteenth century this increase was more rapid in advanced countries than in backward ones, but now it is almost wholly confined to very poor countries. Of these, China and India are numerically the most important, while Russia is the most important in world politics.`

`I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer. War, as I remarked a moment ago, has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full. There would be nothing in this to offend the consciences of the devout or to restrain the ambitions of nationalists. The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what of that? Really high-minded people are indifferent to happiness, especially other people's.`

One illustration of the class system is the contrast between the games of football and cricket.

### British democracy
----------



There is an anonymous quote `Nothing happens in politics by accident, if it happens, it was planned that way`, by some powerful politician. The spirit of this quote will be kept in mind throughout the analysis of democracy here.

class classy mass vulgar slums [chap](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chap)

Carroll Quigley, in *Tragedy and Hope*, makes the following observations:

`...from this political point of view, the greatest difference between Britain and United States rests in the fact that the former has no constitution. This is not generally recognized. Instead, the statement is made that Britain has an unwritten constitution based on customs and conventions. Such a statement seriously misrepresents the facts.`

So, it is not at all clear that the democratic principles and processes are clear and visible to the people. Also, “democracy” may not exactly be run by the people as claimed, but has some authoritarian structures:

`Commons and Cabinet are generally controlled by the same party, the latter controlling the former through the party machinery. This group can do what it wishes with a minimum of publicity or public protest only if the other three parts of the government cooperate. These parts are the monarchy, the House of Lords, and the civil service.`

There are also the coercive parts -- the military, the police and intelligence services. The oaths of all these, like the civil service, are technically owed to the monarch. Then there is the judiciary and lawyers around it, who are called Q. C., *Queen's Counsel*.

`There is no also no separation of powers. The Cabinet “is the government expected to govern not only within the law, but, if necessary, without law or even against the law.”`

This raises doubts about how much the so-called democratic governments keep to its own touted ideal of “rule of law”.

`This situation is sometimes called “Cabinet dictatorship”. It could more be called “party dictatorship”. Both the Cabinet and the Commons are controlled by the party, or more accurately by the inner clique of the party. This inner clique may hold seats in the Cabinet, but the two are not the same thing, since members of one may not be members of the other, and the gradations of power are by no means the same in one as the other.`

### British foreign policy
-------------

The cornerstone of this seems to be Lord Palmerston's quip: `“There are no permanent friends nor permanent enemies; only permanent interests.”` 
Such flexible formulations enabled Britain to direct its policy with all sorts of allies and games of *balance of power*. 
However in reality this flexibility is limited as can be seen by noting certain continuing preferences, which may be the effectively be the interests mentioned in Palmerston's quote.

The U. K. still has significant influence, or at any rate “soft power”, over its erstwhile colonies.
With each of them, with enough persistence, one can find evidence of more and more effects:

1. Australia Brothel Ships[^ReesBrothel]

2. Canada

3. India. Nirad C. Chaudhury[^ChaudhuryAuto] states: `Nehru was completely out of touch with Indian life even of his time, except with the life of the self-segregating Anglicized set of upper India who lived in the so-called Civil Lines. He was educated at home by English tutors, and from the age of sixteen to the age of twenty-three he was in England, i.e. away from all Indian influences in the most formative period of his life.` ..... `The love he professed for India was in no way different from an Indophile Englishman’s.` `He would speak in a very English manner.` `But there was also a linguistic factor which had an influence on his manners. His unaffected English gentleman’s manner was adopted only when one spoke to him in an English which approached his in its accent. Towards anyone who had the Hindi or Bengali accent in his English he would almost behave like an Englishman to a ‘native’. He seemed to have acquired the English sense of ’U’ and ‘non-U’.` `The man drew them aside and peeped in. Nehru jumped up from his chair, caught hold of the intruder by the scruff of the neck, and did not let go until he had marched him to the garden gate. An ordinary Congressman’s career would have been ruined by such conduct. But nobody really minded the residual anglicism in him.`

 U. K.'s professed intents and behaviors are ridden with contradictions ever; a few examples:

1. [BBC once reported that](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23259865) more UK soldiers died by suicide than in military confrontations in the joint U. S./U. K. invasion of Afghanistan.
Technological lead and greater resources, both material and human, are with U. S. and thus military superiority; yet the proportion of U. K.'s s soldiers killed in action there is far fewer; in fact much less than what is caused by psychological trauma.
The reason for U. K. troops better performance, and more suicide rates to go together, is perhaps non-military.
It is worthy to note that U. K. troops have better relations with Afghan militias, friendly enough that there are so few casualties, even though both U. S. and U. K. are there for the same putative reason, enthusiastic participation sending the very best of troops including members of royal family, and should raise a priory same opposition; instead the anger of locals all seem focused on U. S..

2. U. K.'s prime minister Margaret Thatcher [once told children on BBC](http://blogs.reuters.com/global/2010/07/30/cocktails-with-khmer-rouge-killers/) that  “There’s a much, much reasonable grouping within that title, Khmer Rouge ... who will have to play some part in the future government.” The British elite military unit the SAS were later revealed to have trained [Khmer Rouge](http://www.cybercambodia.com/dachs/) fighters. But the BBC itself later on wrote about the Khmer Rouge as [inhuman](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-10684399) [genocidal](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28670568) [monsters](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15814519).

3. U. K.'s press [often criticizes](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination) Congo for the death of Patrice Lumumba; this also includes criticism for Belgium or anybody else suspected to be involved, like the CIA. But some members of MI6 [later](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22006446) [boasted](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n07/letters) that they organized and did it. The execution was particularly horrific; [descriptions include](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba#Foreign_involvement_in_his_death): `Lumumba was forcibly restrained on the flight to Elizabethville .... On arrival, he was conducted under arrest to Brouwez House where he was brutally beaten and tortured ... wished to get rid of the bodies, and did so by digging up and dismembering the bodies, then having them dissolved in sulphuric acid while the bones were ground and scattered.`

### Dialectics and Marxism
------------

Karl Marx

This tendency was analyzed by an author and concluded to be a civilizational death instinct (ref: [1](http://robertlstephens.com/essays/shafarevich/001SocialistPhenomenon.html), [2](https://archive.org/details/SocialistPhenomenon)).
