The name of 2015 Hollywood movie [American Ultra](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3316948/) is a glaring reference to the [MK-Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) program, for evidence of which see e. g., the [congressional hearing](https://publicintelligence.net/ssci-mkultra-1977/) and numerous other citations in the wiki page. 
The movie starring the hugely popular [Kristen Stewart](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576/) and a previous co-paired [Jesse Eisenberg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091722/) makes it palatable to young audiences; the movie ending on a “happy” note, the subject having apparently found a normal life as part of it.
