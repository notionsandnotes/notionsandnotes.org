### Truth as symbolism
----------

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

The [last]({filename}society-politics-state.md) [two]({filename}democracy-britain-empire.md) articles in this series did not investigate the hidden (or in latin, *occultus*) and esoteric in British history, nor did it comment much on implications of history on recent or contemporary politics.
The reason was a discomfort with getting too close to 'hot' topics, whereas the past is at a certain distance and one hopes for more objectivity.
However for both the omitted topics, the contemporary art and literature may be a cultural repository where civilizational experiences are recorded.
It has been known for long that art can contain information which is not immediately obvious; that even the creator of the art need not understand it fully: Socrates, in Plato's [Apology](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html) argues, `“That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.“` Furthermore it is acknowledged for long even by philosophers and theologians too that allegories and metaphors contain truth and wisdom; that these devices are even required:

`“...If you were to wait until they had recognized and grasped the truth, you would undoubtedly come too late; and truth, supposing that it had been found, would surpass their powers of comprehension. In any case an allegorical investiture of it, a parable or myth, is all that would be of any service to them. As Kant said, there must be a public standard of Right and Virtue; it must always flutter high overhead. It is a matter of indifference what heraldic figures are inscribed on it, so long as they signify what is meant. Such an allegorical representation of truth is always and everywhere, for humanity at large, a serviceable substitute for a truth to which it can never attain — for a philosophy which it can never grasp; let alone the fact that it is daily changing its shape, and has in no form as yet met with general acceptance.”` -- *[Religion, a dialogue](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/religion/chapter1.html)*, [Arthur](https://luchte.wordpress.com/the-body-of-sublime-knowledge-the-aesthetic-phenomenology-of-arthur-schopenhauer/) [Schopenhauer](http://www.ciudadseva.com/sevacity/stories/fr/maupassant/beside_schopenhauers_corpse.htm).

`“...You must know that if a person, who has attained a certain degree of perfection, wishes to impart to others, either orally or in writing, any portion of the knowledge which he has acquired of these subjects, he is utterly unable to be as systematic and explicit as he could be in a science of which the method is well known. The same difficulties which he encountered when investigating the subject for himself will attend him when endeavouring to instruct others: viz., at one time the explanation will appear lucid, at another time, obscure: this property of the subject appears to remain the same both to the advanced scholar and to the beginner. For this reason, great theological scholars gave instruction in all such matters only by means of metaphors and allegories.”` -- *[Guide for the Perplexed](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Guide_for_the_Perplexed_(1904))*, [Moses](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/maimonides-rambam/) [Maimonides](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Maimonides.html).

Therefore, art forms may reveal more than straight speech does; and thus we too have the possibility of exploring art to grasp at hidden realities that are not open to immediate neutral discourse. Some go so far as to say that it is actually the other way; that, truth comes out of metaphors, and life imitates art:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

`“What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding.”` -- Friedrich Nietzsche.

`CYRIL. “But you don't mean to say that you seriously believe that Life imitates Art, that Life in fact is the mirror, and Art the reality?”`
` `
`VIVIAN. “Certainly I do. Paradox though it may seem--and paradoxes are always dangerous things--it is none the less true that Life imitates art far more than Art imitates life.”` -- *[On the Decay of Lying, An Observation](http://www.online-literature.com/wilde/1307/)*, Oscar Wilde.

Therefore with profit we might look at British art to continue understanding British and Western society and culture.



### Doctor Faustus
-------------

*[necromancy]: the supposed branch of magic of raising the dead

Our primary focus was on English history and to derive further insight from the esoteric on its enigmatic rise, one may consider that up to the fifteenth century, it was very much a Catholic nation like all others in Europe and not extraordinarily powerful in relative position. 
Only later on did the English state transform into one with the so-called English liberal values.
One of the important writers of the transitional era is [Christopher Marlowe](http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/marlowebio.htm)[^MarloweFaustus]'s [Doctor Faustus](http://genius.com/Christopher-marlowe-the-tragical-history-of-doctor-faustus-full-text-annotated) was a play written before English state completed its transformation to its so-called liberal form. Briefly, the learned but dissatisfied Dr. Faustus explores necromancy, summons spirits from the netherworld and negotiates and sells his soul to the devil to have Mephistopheles as his servant for 24 years in exchange for Faustus's soul at the end of it.

The original Dr. Faustus is from a Germanic folk tale. Nevertheless the cultural notion of summoning demons and making contracts for great material benefits is ancient and ubiquitous whether in the East or the West. In Christianity, an encounter with the Devil is described in [Matthew 4:8-9](http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/4:8): `Then the devil took him up to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their magnificence, and he said to him, “All these I shall give to you, if you will prostrate yourself and worship me.”` Rejection of this temptation is fundamental to Christian doctrine; [Matthew 16:26](http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/16:26) asks, `What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? Or what can one give in exchange for his life?`

Indeed, England did abandon submission to the Catholic Church, adopted liberal ideas and rose in status to eventually overcome whole of Europe and dominate the world; many Englishmen did experience some of the aforementioned magnificence: `Born in humble stations, accustomed to earn a slender maintenance by obscure industry, they found themselves transformed in a few months from clerks drudging over desks, or captains in marching regiments, into statesmen and generals, with armies at their command, with the revenues of kingdoms at their disposal, with power to make and depose sovereigns at their pleasure.`[^MacaulayGI]
It reached achievements unknown so far in history; a rise which is “[Faustian](/weblog/politics/society-politics-state-1.html#on-the-nature-of-the-west)” according to Spengler. 
Was Marlowe's drama art expressing angst about eventual course?
The demonic, necromantic stories may not all be purely in the realm of poetry; actual “Magick” ceremonies may indeed have been performed. 
Faustus-like contemporary of Marlowe was [John Dee](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dee) the court magician and *alchemist* of later Tudor era:

{% figure /images/johndee.jpg caption="John Dee demonstrating an experiment in the court of Queen Elizabeth - I" href="http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/john-dee-performing-an-experiment-before-elizabeth-i-125915" %}

This *alchemy* may not have been just an innocuous precursor to modern chemistry. 
There exist [macabre allusions](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/17/john-dee-painting-circle-of-human-skulls-exhibition) about his activities that represent it much like what necromancy might be; 
check this video at time 14:100 on exhibition at the English Royal College of Physicians:

{% youtube Zu2D4vpTkv8 %}

There were many later *alchemists* among English nobility; as an example Isaac Newton is [known to have written on it](http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=82&cat=Alchemy).
Regardless of the questions of existence of demons, viability of procedures and eventual fate of human soul, it is consequential that the powerful nobility believed or indulged in what may be *alchemy* and other esoterica.
Due to pausity of evidence available in mainstream educational material, it is difficult to conclude anything more but that the esoteric did play a role may be noted for now.

### Paradise Lost
-------------

`The mind is its own place, and in itself 
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.`

`“Knowledge forbidden?
Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord
Envy them that? Can it be a sin to know?
Can it be death?”`

`Here we may reign secure, and in my choice 
To reign is worth ambition though in hell: 
Better to reign in hell, than serve in heaven.`

`ON HIS BLINDNESS
When I consider how my light is spent,
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
And that one Talent which is death to hide
Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest he returning chide;
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”
I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need
Either man’s work or his own gifts; who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed
And post o’er Land and Ocean without rest:
They also serve who only stand and wait.”`

### Dracula
--------

Prince Charles often jokes about his ancestral relation to Vlad the Impaler and takes particular care to cultivate this connection (refs: [1](http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/595780/Prince-Charles-Dracula-Transylvanian-countryside-love), [2](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vlad-the-impaler-how-is-prince-charles-queen-elizabeth-related-to-him/), [3](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9656769/Prince-Charles-heir-to-Draculas-blood-line.html))

### Eyes Wide Shut
-----------

Although this movie of Stanley Kubrick takes place in the United States, its ideas can be seen to have British origins.

[Cornelius Fudge](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/cs/rg-cs14.html), the Minister for Magic, together with the rich Lucius Malfoy, arrests Rubeus Hagrid to save his face, blustering: `“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said. But I’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my duty”` and later Hagrid turns out the be innocent.

Magical world is separate from the so-called muggle or mundane world formally by the [Statute of Secrecy](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy) of 1689, which is remarkably close to the [Glorious English Revolution](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-glorious-revolution-of-1688/) of 1688.

The English people riot often and since time immemmorial; [a list of major riots in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_riots_in_London) is instructive to check.

### George Orwell 1984
--------

`The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.`

British secret courts

`O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The command of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "Thou art". No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford in the end we broke them down. I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean.'`

`'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.'`

`'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not, what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.'`

`'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.' He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?'`

`Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.`

`'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self− abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always do not forget this, Winston always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face for ever.'`

`He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen.` 
`O'Brien went on:` 
`'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it.'`

`He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak.`

`Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.`

### As influence and programming
----------------

Numerous academic studies point out that the youth grow up seeing a very large amount of violence in movies, television and other media and gets desensitized; e. g., [one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393354/) quotes that an average 18-year old has seen about 6000 acts of violence on the screen.
A few more samples of papers on this topic obtained on a cursory search: [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581845/), [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2679529/), [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522002/), [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533816/), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505223/), [6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1381091/), [7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24014349), [8](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25455576). The studies concur that violence in media does substantially effect psychology. Other cultural components are also responsible such a [video](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4343312/) [games](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229070/) and [nursery rhymes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1719761/), which may contain violence. 

James Bond

Who are typical James Bond type characters? First is Lawrence of Arabia[^AndersonLawrence] (refs: [1](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/books/review/lawrence-in-arabia-by-scott-anderson.html?_r=0), [2](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/1.713171), [3](http://www.livescience.com/54321-lawrence-of-arabia-bullet-found.html), [4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/lawrence_te.shtml), [5](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-lawrence-arabia-180951857/?no-ist)). 

Another is Orde Wingate, who was of crucial influence for formation of Israel, in Ethiopean war against Italy, and in the Burma theater of second world war (refs: [1](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wingate.html), [2](http://www.zionism-israel.com/bio/Charles_Orde_Wingate.htm), [3](http://azure.org.il/include/print.php?id=279), [4](http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/from-aharai-to-afghanistan-remembering-orde-wingate/), [5](https://medium.com/the-bridge/orde-wingate-and-combat-leadership-c389662a2eef#.g9t0kj89j), [6](http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/6235/features/the-mad-zionist/), [7](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wingate-dies-in-burma), [8](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-eisenman/post_2154_b_884195.html), [9](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-eisenman/post_2153_b_884193.html)).
