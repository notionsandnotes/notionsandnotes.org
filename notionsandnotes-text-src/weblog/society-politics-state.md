<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

The origins of these writings are quests I found myself in, to further awareness about ambient society and the state power(s) that rules over it. 
Here I not only found myself lacking, but also found to hav been deeply in error in some foundational assumptions and beliefs.
This is a humble moment of *mea culpa* about confident stupidity; of little consolation is that company may be found as in the experimentally (e. g.: [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702783/)) observed [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://psmag.com/we-are-all-confident-idiots-56a60eb7febc). 
There were enough cautions to take heed, right from the start of life in numerous folk and moral tales from childhood no matter where (e. g.: [1](http://www.read.gov/aesop/001.html), [2](http://literaturnetz.org/grimms_maerchen), [3](http://www.literaturepage.com/read/grimms-fairy-tales.html), [4](http://sacred-texts.com/shi/atfj/index.htm), [5](http://www.talesofpanchatantra.com/works/complete)) or later in formal education eg the exposure of [rhetorical fallacies](http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html), or notes of warning by numerous thinkers in considered writings, e. g. by philosophers:

`“...Nature goes to work like Shakespeare and Goethe, poets who make every one of their characters — even if it is the devil himself! — appear to be quite in the right for the moment that they come before us in their several parts; the characters are described so objectively that they excite our interest and compel us to sympathize with their point of view; for, like the works of Nature, every one of these characters is evolved as the result of some hidden law or principle, which makes all they say and do appear natural and therefore necessary. And you will always be the prey or the plaything of the devils and fools in this world, if you expect to see them going about with horns or jangling their bells.”` -- [Counsels and Maxims](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/counsels/complete.html)[^SchopenhauerCounsels], Arthur Schopenhauer.

or religious scholars:

`“...when man is able to comprehend certain things, it does not follow that he must be able to comprehend everything.”` -- [Ch. 31](http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp041.htm), [Guide for the Perplexed](https://archive.org/details/guideforperplexe00maim)[^MaimonidesPerplexed], [Moses](http://www.jewishhistory.org/maimonides/) [Maimonides](http://www.iep.utm.edu/maimonid/).

Why did this downfall occur? An fundamental bad habit seems to be lazy parroting of what one is presented with; as [Emerson puts it](http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm), `“I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right.”`; or, `“Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination plays us false.”`.

This writing is a very tentative step towards re-examination; as when, in Emerson's words, `“There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction  that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion..”`. The search is to begin anew with [no](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20798678) guarantee of correctness by reason of being mired in the quicksands of erroneous habits; yet, one has to try. One of said old habits is, again borrowing Emerson: `“Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage.”`; I should confess inability yet to do without such crutches of quoting “sages” now, if nothing else, to add to the rhetorical defensive formation so to speak; but this may be a start.

### The Method
-------------

 My notes here are effort to lessen confusion of the overwhelming wilderness since facing discontinuity in graduate school, or if one were open to the esoteric, upon the [return of Saturn](http://astrology.about.com/od/advancedastrology/p/SaturnReturn.htm). This is an unambitious meander of thoughts, burrowing further and further into lost feelings and the roots of the issues, and resulting observations not particularly intended to form a coherent thesis. If any, the theme may be that everything known about personal objectives, relations to others and overall the society and politics that subsume it all, need to be looked afresh and revised for mistakes, with the humbling thought that possibly *I do not know anything* -- somewhat like Socrates claimed in Plato's *[Apology](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html)*; but, unlike him saying that a lot of other supposed knowledgeable people too do not in reality know anything, I criticize only myself.

 There is no immediate end in sight -- but I hope all this angst is not entirely pointless either; perhaps, by such routine contemplation, either I myself, or somebody later following, may find better much later some good insights à la [Grothendieck](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/RisingSea.pdf): `“The ... analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months—when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado! A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance.”`; and so I release these little pieces of thoughts on to the open internet.

 I mainly concentrate on the Western civilization and a West-centric viewpoint, one with special mention to the so-called Anglo-Saxon countries, U. K. and U. S.. The reason for ignoring the others (for the moment) except in the restricted context of their relation to the Western civilization, is first, to start with the most powerful, influential and overwhelming group, and next, due to a doubt (to be dealt with later) that the perspectives about other civilizations are probably colored in particular ways, by geopolitical and historical compulsions and so likely to be more problematic and thus more difficult to deconstruct; whereas things may perhaps be easier with the more transparent (at any rate, putatively) social and state structures of the West.

### Argument against
------------------

 Why should a non-specialist study the surrounding human and social relations, and the hierarchical structures often ruling over them?
Why should one, whose task is creation of value in some limited context, deviate from their duty of production, of duty to their family or contracts or oaths or other personal obligations, to distractions and disruptions such as study their rulers who are not necessarily productive?
The rulers are supposed to reward “good” servants and promote greater production and profits, and the underlings and common people are supposed to sincerely do their work.
Good guys win, bad guys lose and when necessary “the powers” enforce this.
Popular narratives and numerous historical and folk stories taught throughout the world reinforce this.

 About the so-called “masses”, [George](http://georgerrmartin.com/life/) [R.](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/George_R._R._Martin) [R.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/9945808/Game-of-Thrones-Interview-with-George-RR-Martin.html) [Martin](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/George_R.R._Martin) [states](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/268711-the-common-people-pray-for-rain-healthy-children-and-a): `“The common people pray for rain, healthy children and a summer that never ends. It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.”`

 For mathematicians, according to E. T. Bell[^ETBell], both Lagrange and Laplace were honored irrespective of the numerous regime changes during the turbulence of French revolution and later Napoleonic France.

 The corporate world also emphasizes communication skills with an [endless](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Communication-Skills/zgbs/books/2560) [number](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Business-Negotiating/zgbs/books/2686/ref=zg_bs_nav_b_4_2560) of books on it. Even exotic books like [The Tao of programming](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html)[^TaoOfProgramming] states: 

`A novice asked the Master: “In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?”`
` `
`The Master replied: “You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?”`

 This exists in religion also. The [parable of the talents](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A14-30&version=KJV) for example seems to be a cornerstone of [protestant work ethic](https://archive.org/details/protestantethics00webe)[^MaxWeber1930] to focus intensely on work; the concept is repeated by [Benjamin Franklin](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0130) among others.

 Not only there is much incentive as above to not bother too much, but also any deeper explorations often take one down dead alleys or rabbit hole; one problem for example being overwhelmed by junk, as stated eg in [Sturgeon's law](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/Sturgeons-Law.html); another being misleading dead avenues of quest, which may land us in [colorful conspiracy theories](http://www.skepdic.com/illuminati.html) -- perhaps the misleading avenues are deliberately there. 

Perhaps not just one's assumed core beliefs, but also expressions of doubt may be designed to be directed in certain ways -- and, secondly, if at all one uncovers unpublicized facts and truths, what one may do with them --  wrote that one must be very careful in speaking about certain things should he discover them. 


### Argument for
--------------

`“The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.”` -- Plato, Republic.

`“If voting made any difference they wouldn't let us do it.”` ― Mark Twain

Emerson [argues](http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm) that inertia and conformity saps vitality:

`The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers, — under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. And, of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blindman's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that, with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution, he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, — the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean "the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved, but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.`

Emerson is one of the foremost American philosophers and insistent on individual expression and freedom.
Those who are not of such a disposition may choose to differ; so, we seek examples in earlier traditions.
It turns out to be a recurring theme with both conservatives and radicals.
The early Church father [Tertullian](http://www.ntcanon.org/Tertullian.shtml) writes [against heresies](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm); even this is not entirely reliable; the gravity of the problem is evident by noting that the writer himself later on became a disapproved [Montanist](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm).
Luther on the other hand started out questioning the Church; thus was a “heretic”, but [did not allow](http://www.truecovenanter.com/truelutheran/luther_against_the_antinomians.html) “heresies” himself; this was not mere rhetoric; both the breaking away and consolidation of protestants involved much bloodshed (e. g., the [Thirty Years War](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14648b.htm)[^WilsonThirtyYearsWar].

 Even a relatively isolated person can be, and often is, directly affected by socio-political events and issues, pure mathematicians not excepted, e. g., [Archimedes in a Rome - Syracuse war](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/marcellu.html), Poncelet in Napoleon's war with Russia, [Chebotarev in Russian civil war](http://websites.math.leidenuniv.nl/algebra/chebotarev.pdf), [Igor Tamm](http://elr3to.blogspot.in/2013/04/i-tamm-and-remainder-term-in-taylors.html), migration of numerous mathematicians like Chern, Nöther, Artin, Hasse, Teichmüller, Weil during second world war, or deaths of [Galois](http://www.galois-group.net/g/EN/duel.html), [Hausdorff](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/about-hcm/mathematics-in-bonn/history-of-mathematics-in-bonn/about-felix-hausdorff/), [Taniyama](http://blms.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/186.full.pdf) and so on.
This is not even the tip of iceberg and the majority of cases are unreported; everyone would no doubt know many personally.

 Notwithstanding later [legal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment) [debates](http://www.constitution.org/mil/embar2nd.htm), the original statement of the second amendment to the constitution of the U. S. in the [Bill of Rights](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html) reads: *A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.* If, as stated, it is not clear that state alone should be trusted with security and regulated militia are necessary, why not the same with civics and politics? Why not independent study, reinforced by the right of freedom of expression which is a supposed cornerstone of democracy?

 Similarly workers in corporate offices and other organizations too witness complex individual aspirations and group dynamics.
Numerous works have been written on this; doubts have been expressed about big corporate or other hierarchies with power assignations; see e. g., [“You weren't meant to have a boss”](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html) and [Perils of Obedience](http://www.paulgraham.com/perils.html) by [Y-combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) co-founder [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/), the cynical [Peter principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) was stated, that managers get promoted to their level of incompetence, or its extension [Gervais principle](http://ribbonfarm.com), which has models of three-layer social structures, consisting of the *losers*, the *clueless* and the *sociopaths*, suggesting that the aforementioned phenomenon is of deliberate design and not at all accidental. There are more definite studies in the [Milgram](http://www.nature.com/news/modern-milgram-experiment-sheds-light-on-power-of-authority-1.19408) [experiments](http://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html) or [Stanford](https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40741) [Prison](http://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html) [experiments](http://www.prisonexp.org/conclusion). Criticisms also exist of various technocratic devices like [software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/software-literary-patents.html) [patents](http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html).

`“Do not consider a statement true because you find it in a book, for the prevaricator is as little restrained with his pen as with his tongue. For the untutored and uninstructed are convinced of the veracity of a statement by the mere fact that it is written; nevertheless its accuracy must be demonstrated in another manner.”` -- [page xiv](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Yemen/XIV) of [Epistle to Yemen](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Yemen), [Moses ](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/75991/jewish/Maimonides-His-Life-and-Works.htm) [Maimonides](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11124-moses-ben-maimon).

Konrad Adenauer in an [interview with Gunter Gaus](http://www.konrad-adenauer.de/index.php?cID=4202) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90EVIH4KZsc)) concedes that even with the best of intentions a politician may not be able to speak the full truth: `Nun werden Sie sagen, der Politiker kann nicht immer alles sagen; da haben Sie Recht. Aber das, was er sagt, muß wahr sein. Natürlich kann er nicht alles immer sagen; das ist so selbstverständlich, daß ich kein Wort dazu zu sagen brauche. Aber der Politiker soll in dem, was er sagt, ehrlich sein.`; trans: *You are right with saying that the politician isn´t able to say everything at every time. But all what a politician says has to be true. Of course he can´t say everything to every time. This is self-evident in a way, I have nothing more to say about it. But the politician should be honest, when he says something. Further,  a politician may not be able to speak the full truth*; and furthermore, `Gaus: Sie sind mit Verschweigen immer durchgekommen? Adenauer: Mit Schweigen, nicht mit Verschweigen. Ich bitte doch festzuhalten, was da für ein Unterschied ist. In der Politik versteht jeder, wenn der Vertragspartner zu hören bekommt: Ich bitte um Entschuldigung, wenn ich hierauf keine Antwort gebe`; trans: *Gaus: You have always come through with concealment? Adenauer: With silence, not with concealment. I beg you to record, that there is a difference. And also in policy everybody understands, when your opponent doesn´t tell you everything.*

However I might have a bit more latitude due to my apolitical nature and life, very unlikely to foment problems for those with political power or programs.

This article also try to write things in the most general terms so as not to come into conflict with any current agenda, and, when specifics are mentioned, they are at least at a certain distance from the present.

Therefore what follows may be considered in reference to the most general or generic society anywhere; even use of English language is only because of the author's own limits of perception, learning and background; civil structures and dominant languages may change through history, but basic relations, ideas and philosophy can continue.

`There are three ways of securing a society that shall be stable as regards population. The first is that of birth control, the second that of infanticide or really destructive wars, and the third that of general misery except for a powerful minority. All these methods have been practiced: the first, for example, by the Australian aborigines; the second by the Aztecs, the Spartans, and the rulers of Plato's Republic; the third in the world as some Western internationalists hope to make it and in Soviet Russia. (It is not to be supposed that Indians and Chinese like starving, but they have to endure it because the armaments of the West are too strong for them.)`

`How very strange! When their masters were kings, the peoples never stopped complaining at having to pay war. taxes. Then, when they have overthrown these masters and taken to taxing themselves, the currency in which they pay is not merely a part of their incomes but their very lives!`

### State and society
----------

Why are societies formed? Here we make a brief assumption that a lonely life is too tough and there are multitudinous advantages with human collectives.

 Societies can function more effectively than separate individuals by division of labor. This leads to creation of social units and classes. It is not a priory clear which social classes formed first and how they evolved; the following restricts to a description of a few classes without the nitty-gritties.

 The foremost important socio-economic unit is the family, where parents raise and train children for adult life and generally pass on their knowledge and possessions. In theory, a man or woman can live in isolation, at least for some time, if s/he is able to find or produce food and able to tackle the challenges of nature. However a union of man and woman is required to bring forth the next generation, and then begins the arduos task of preparing them for life. The custom of marriage arose at some point of time; children preferring both parents to live together partnering exclusively. This exclusive partnership between man and woman as father and mother of a family may not always be the case in society and history but it did and does exist almost everywhere and extensively.

 Next most important thing is to be able to defend oneself against any threats, either human or non-human. Specialized training for this may have given rise to the warrior class. Once formed, they would have been self-sustaining. As to the how, beyond the justifications of humans getting together for welfare, progress etc., there is the following very interesting anecdote by the Church father St. Augustine on the nature of kingdoms:

`“How Like Kingdoms Without Justice are to Robberies”
    Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies?  For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms?  The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on.  If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity.  Indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized.  For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, “What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great fleet art styled emperor.”` -- [St. Augustine of Hippo](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02084a.htm), [De Civitate Dei](http://www.augustinus.it/latino/cdd/index2.htm), *[City of God](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm)*, [Bk. IV](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120104.htm), [Ch. 4.](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.IV.4.html).

 The above implies that kingdoms may be formed out of organized crime gangs. Were hierarchies and autocracies first formed by dominant strongmen, the lesser ones appeasing the bigger? But this ultimately requires what is equivalent of military power and a single person can have only so much of physical and battle prowess; for more he must again be able to use the organized forces of a collective militia and must possess what may be called “leadership skills”.

It was assumed here that this leader was a man, as raw physical ability and nomadic adventurism or aggression probably were more 'manly'. However leader of a society need not always have been a man. There are historical signs of matriarchal societies. How these formed and how shifts to/from patriarchy were made, are intriguing questions -- a good source may be old folktales and cultural memories. Augustine's anedcote suggests a militant group being able to dominate and coerce resource extraction from less militant ones. State powers are inextricably linked with elite classes who are either militant themselves or are able to control militia. Even till date, the state extracts resources from its subjects, engages in or sponsors warfare and also coerces populations; in fact, the state power may be a supreme expression of force.

Ancient trade routes: evidence exists for trade as far back as the [stone age](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/1996/12/stone-age-sea-merchants) and even historic [late ice age](http://www.archatlas.org/ObsidianRoutes/ObsidianRoutes.php).

The aforementioned four social classes of laborer/producer, warrior, intellectual and trader may be juxtaposed with the traditional two of English society, viz., classes and masses, classes consisting of those propertied and interrelated families and individuals, and having leisure to either enjoy or rule the working masses. In contrast, Marxist theory has two classes, bourgeois and proletariat, and the inevitable dialectics of class struggle between the two, which is a continuation from earlier struggles between aristocracy and peasants/serfs of the European feudal era, or the elite citizens and plebeians/slaves of classical civilization. Lenin in contrast claimed that the European workers are better-treated than Russians, with the concept of “labour aristocracy” and requiring an elite revolutionary vanguard in order to guide the proletariat. Mao's Sinification of the Marxist theory formulates multiple social classes, which may further keep forming, supposedly requiring eternal class struggle. All these varied descriptions show that neat boxed classifications never quite fit the actual society.


### Elites and Sociology
----------------

For many in the science and engineering streams, especially research, there is a dim view of humanities research topics. 
This pre-existing feeling was re-inforced by happenings like the Sokal affair (refs: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair), [2](http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/weinberg.html), [3](http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html)). Regarding later developments, personally having focused on technology or pure mathematics, even a cursory look of certain sociology topics, e. g., Postmodern, Feminist or Transgender studies (a sample list of peer-reviewed papers, for other isolated engineering or science graduates to check: [1](http://csc.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/05/03/1532708616640564.abstract), [2](http://epd.sagepub.com/content/33/6/1098), [3](http://tap.sagepub.com/content/4/3/345.abstract), [4](http://fty.sagepub.com/content/16/2/153.abstract), [5](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23268743.2015.1056632?src=recsys&), [6](http://epd.sagepub.com/content/33/5/769.extract), [7](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/251864), [8](http://sex.sagepub.com/content/15/3-4/373.short), [9](http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/14/2/230), [10](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12062/abstract), [11](http://ecs.sagepub.com/content/16/5/582.abstract), [12](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2008.01026.x/abstract), [13](http://hum.sagepub.com/content/68/9/1461.abstract), [14](http://gas.sagepub.com/content/8/3/363.abstract), [15](http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/18/4/65.abstract), [16](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687599.2016.1188767?journalCode=cdso20), [17](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540253.2016.1197384?journalCode=cgee20), [18](http://irs.sagepub.com/content/46/1/108.abstract), [19](http://www.gamejournal.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GAME_3_Subcultures_Gallagher.pdf), [20](http://sms.sagepub.com/content/2/2/2056305116641976.abstract), [21](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/10/07/1461444815608807.abstract), [22](http://jce.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/08/27/0891241615605218.abstract), [23](http://jce.sagepub.com/content/35/6/645.short), [24](http://has.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/04/13/0160597616640308.short), [25](http://gac.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/04/13/1555412016640408.abstract)), does not fill me with ease. 

However, it is a great mistake to hold such dismissive attitudes to sociology. 
These studies are often used for policy decisions and people are educated according to the latest developments and trends.
Thus it will eventually affect the personal and social lives of everyone, including even isolated people like mathematicians too.

Also the picture of sociology and humanities in general presented to non-specialists or the middle or working classes, need not entirely be whole or accurate.
The elites may get to further their education beyond what is usually the case with commons.
Elite by definition get a lot more social and life choices than others; therefore in education too they have access to a lot more and can study a lot deeper; e. g., for a historic example, much before the present amenities, two letters ([1](http://founders.archives.gov/?q=%20Author%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20carr%20Recipient%3A%22Carr%2C%20Peter%22&s=2111311111&r=2), [2](http://founders.archives.gov/?q=%20Author%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20carr%20Recipient%3A%22Carr%2C%20Peter%22&s=2111311111&r=3)) from Thomas Jefferson to his teenage nephew give a substantial reading list. 
This is not just superficial reading either; mathematics is just one of the topics besides deeper classical studies and there he mentions [Bezout](http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath544/kmath544.htm), which might as well be considered state of the art of pure mathematics research then in the eighteenth century.

The Latin and Greek classic sources are studied in their originals and not mere translations -- this is sophisticated Latin and Greek, intended for the highly educated, as opposed to the *vulgate* in which e. g., the bible was written, and it is not at all trivial a trivial education in humanities and social studies.
This is also part of the very thing that makes elite the elite; their greater social choices necessitates them to have greater social knowledge to operate the levers of power, so to speak.
Non-specialists or commons who only worry about a stable income and maybe a future for their children take sociology and humanities as a pastime; at most as part of general education.
This is not at all so for the elite and it is a vital matter for them; that the commons do not have their level of understanding makes this a hidden knowledge in practice, which the elite may use to exercise their power.
After realizing this, the others have no reason for complacence after earning a university degree or two; they must over the generations try to catch up and bridge the gaps, at least over generations, to understand what is happening to them.


### The elite and the commons
------------------------

The above discussion requires further examination and clarification of what the elite are.

Elite may be defined to be the top layer of the social hierarchy; those who have power. 
What is the source of this power?
One man (or woman) can only do so much.
The elites gain their huge power by controlling others to achieve their ends.

One example is a rich elite employing a host of people for various tasks in exchange for payment; this further increasing or sustaining the wealth, thus enabling continued hiring of people.
An indicator of the elite is their wealth; but this need not be the only one.
There are numerous “get rich” books with the object of how to acquire wealth; e. g. Robert Kiyosaki[^KiyosakiRichDad] details differences between mindsets and methods of rich people and poor people and how people can become rich with more effective methods.
Such pointers may be helpful in preventing phenomena like lottery winners squandering away their wealth in short order; however, these also do not disrupt the distinction between the elite and the commons, as these methods all involve extracting surplus from others labor or social institutions systematically, step by step, and ensuring that such cash flow stays on.

Furthermore, being rich is only one aspect of the elite.
If a person is the leader of a huge militia, with commanding power, then that makes him an elite even going by the richness mandate, as the coercive power can be used to extract wealth.
For example, the so-called [Robber barons](https://next.ft.com/content/c3e6d1bc-aa31-11df-9367-00144feabdc0) controlled towns on the [Rhine river](http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/UCSBpf/readings/gardnerTollingtheRhine.pdf) and charged exorbitant tolls (more refs: [1](http://www.burgerbe.de/2013/05/04/die-raubritter-von-burg-sooneck/), [2](http://www.worms.de/de/kultur/stadtgeschichte/wussten-sie-es/liste/2012-05_ibersheim-raubritter-mauderich.php), [3](http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/urn/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-487905), [4](http://opac.regesta-imperii.de/lang_de/suche.php?qs=&ts=Rheinzoll*&ps=&tags=&sprache=&objektart=alle&pagesize=20&sortierung=d&ejahr=)) for the goods passing through and became rich, so that, even if we start with the definition of the elite being those who are wealthy, it will need to be modified to include those who possess armed coercive power.
In particular, this will include controllers of state power and its enforcement arms.

The more organized a society is, the more its elites acquire power.
They know how to control society from their privileged position. 
Such knowledge is either inherited from the previous generation, or sometimes recruit from the nearest social classes.

#### State and its branches
----------

State requires existence of military, the ultimate instrument of its coercive powers.
It is a problem for the rulers as to how to control and restrain this power, even as keeping it sharp for focussed application on selected targets. [Machiavelli writes](http://erenow.com/ww/the-art-of-war-machiavelli/5.html)[^MachiavelliArtofWar]: `I say, then, that even such governments should fear those persons who make war their only business; and this is because the strength of all armies, without a doubt, consists in their infantry. And if a prince has not enough power over his infantry to make them disband and return cheerfully to their former occupations when a war is over, he is on the road to being ruined. For no infantry can be so dangerous as that which is composed of men who make war their only calling, because a prince either must keep them continually engaged in war, or must constantly keep them paid in peacetime, or must run the risk of their stripping him of his kingdom. But it is impossible to keep them forever engaged in war, or forever paid when war is over; therefore, a prince must run no small risk of losing his kingdom.`

### On the nature of the West
-----------

Oswald Spengler[^SpenglerDecline] states that the Western world is “Faustian”.

Exactly how it is Faustian? 
de Jouvenel[^deJouvenelPower] argues that each change of state, each revolution, consists of a Faustian bargain between the people for more privileges, but also sacrifices demanded to a previously unheard extent.
