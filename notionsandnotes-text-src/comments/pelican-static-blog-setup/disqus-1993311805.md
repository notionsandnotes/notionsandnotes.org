Really well put together article.

As an aside, you can also use GitHub Pages for hosting, which is free, and then integrate it with Travis-CI to automatically publish the blog (basically run pelican to generate the output and push the changes back online) in order to decouple the actual writing of blog posts from the publishing part.

The above also has the advantage of enabling a history of changes done (both for the articles themselves and the output), as well as simplifying things if you want to have guest posts and so on.
